# Human Activity Recognition from IMU data using Deep Learning with Tensorflow

This folder contains the slides and the code corresponding to a tutorial presented as guest lecture in UCLA's ECE M202A / CS M213A course on how to process IMU sensor data using deep neural networks to detect human activities. The files were copied from https://github.com/vikranth94/Activity-Recognition.

The preprocessed version of the PAMAP2 dataset used in the tutorial is available at  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SUM6GL2RHGZg4Ef2O_3IKCFvCxqTpjDd?usp=sharing.
